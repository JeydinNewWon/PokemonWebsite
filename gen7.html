          The player starts off moving from the Kanto region to the Alola region's Melemele Island with their mother. They meet Professor Kukui, who tells them that the island kahuna is willing to give a free starter Pokémon to any trainer. However, when they reach the kahuna's residence in Iki Town, they find the town square empty. Professor Kukui asks the player to go and check if the townspeople are around the ruins that honor the island's guardian deity, Tapu Koko. The player meets Lillie and despite not having any Pokémon, helps protect her special Pokémon, nicknamed Nebby, from a flock of Spearow. However in trying to defend the player and itself, Nebby destroys the bridge leading to the ruins, causing the player to fall. However, they are promptly saved by Tapu Koko, who leaves a mysterious stone on the ground for the player to find. Back in Iki Town, the player meets and gets their starter Pokémon from Kahuna Hala, and then meets and defeats Hau, the grandson of Hala. After a festival where the player once again defeats Hau, the player travels to Professor Kukui's lab, where they are then given a Rotom Dex by the Professor. He then proceeds to tell the player and Hau about island challenges, and asks them to visit the Trainer's School. The player then reaches the Trainer's School and defeats the four top students and teacher, then meets Ilima, a trial captain. After leaving the Trainer's School and meeting with Ilima again, the two are challenged by Team Skull, who are promptly defeated by the player and Ilima. The player then travels around to the opposite side of the island and completes Ilama's trial, obtaining their first Z-crystal in the process.

          After informing and battling Hala, the player, Lillie and Hau travel to Akala Island. There, they complete the second trial and battle Team Skull's enforcer, Gladion. The player then fights several more Team Skull members and completes more Trials, culminating in the player defeating the second Kahuna, Olivia. The player and Hau are then invited to visit the Aether Paradise, where they meet the Aether Foundation's president, Lusamine, and battle the first Ultra Beast, UB-01 Symbiont (later revealed to be called Nihilego), which had suddenly appeared from a mysterious portal. The player leaves the Paradise and completes another Trial on Ula'ula Island before meeting and battling Plumeria and Team Skull's leader, Guzma. Following another trial, Team Skull attacks the house where Acerola, the trial captain, lives and steals a Pokémon, leading the player to travel to Po Town, a town completely taken over by Team Skull. After defeating Guzma again and returning the Pokémon, the player learns that stealing the Pokemon was a set up to distract the player and Acerola, and while they were gone, Team Skull kidnapped Lillie and Nebby. Hau and the player team up with Gladion against the Aether Foundation, which is revealed to be working with Team Skull. They encounter Guzma again, who defeats Gladion but is defeated by the player. They then rescue Lillie and battle the true mastermind Lusamine, who reveals that Lillie and Gladion are her children before using Nebby's power to summon Ultra Beasts, not caring about Lillie's concern that doing so would cost Nebby's life. The player defeats her in a Pokémon battle while Gladion defeats another Nihilego, but Guzma and Lusamine escape through the portal Nihilego appeared in, while each respective Kahuna and their Tapu battle Ultra Beasts that appear on each island.

          While under the strain caused by Lusamine, Nebby evolves and becomes unresponsive. Due to this, Lillie and the player journey to Poni Island to visit the game's respective altar; The Altar of the Sunne/Moone. When they arrive, Lille and the player play the Flutes of the Sunne and Moone, causing Nebby to evolve into the game's mascot, Lunala for Moon or Solgaleo for Sun. Using the power of the legendary Pokémon, the player and Lillie travel to Ultra Space to stop Lusamine and Guzma. The player and Lillie encounter Guzma, who informs them with troubling news of the full scope of Lusamine's psychopathic pursuit of her own ambition after he was chased and attacked by a Nihilego he attempted to catch. When she is encountered, it is revealed that Lusamine had caused the Ultra Beast crisis so that she could live a solitary life amongst the Nihilego in their home realm at the expense of Alola itself. Losing all patience with Lillie after being called terrible and not wanting to give up her new life without a fight, Lusamine allows a Nihilego she caught to take control over her, turning the rogue Aether President into a terrifying hybrid monster, the "Mother Beast", before sending out her Pokémon -their power increased as a result of her transformation- to attack the player in attempt to seek vengeance for her daughter's defiance. After her enhanced Pokémon are defeated, the mutated Lusamine -refusing to accept defeat and consumed by animalistic bloodlust- makes a last-ditch attempt to punish Lillie herself, but Nebby intervenes and causes Lusamine and Nihilego to un-merge and the former to collapse. Nebby transports the heroes, Guzma, and Lusamine (now returned to her normal self) back to Alola. Lillie then gives the player the chance to capture Nebby. After the defeat of Lusamine and the Aether Foundation, the player climbs to the top of Mount Lanakila on Ula'ula Island, battles Gladion and Hau, and defeats the Elite Four, composed of Hala, Olivia, Acerola, and Kahili, at Professor Kukui's request. The player subsequently battles Kukui and wins, becoming the first-ever champion of the Alola Region. Everyone the player has met on their journey celebrates the occasion, though Lillie and the player sneak off to meet Tapu Koko, and the player is given a chance to battle and capture it. The next day, Hau informs the player that Lillie is leaving Alola. At Hau'oli City ferry terminal Lillie tells her friends that she wants to head to Kanto, to meet the Pokemon Storage System creator Bill, who went through the same experience of merging with a Pokemon to help Lusamine get better, and also to become a better Trainer.

          After becoming the champion, the player is contacted by two members of the International Police: Looker and Anabel, the latter of whom was the former head of the Battle Tower in Pokémon Emerald. The two contract the player to assist with capturing or subduing the remaining wild Ultra Beasts—Nihilego, Buzzwole/Pheromosa, Xurkitree, Kartana/Celesteela, and Guzzlord—to protect Alola. After this quest is finished, Looker urgently reveals that he saw another Ultra Beast, although Anabel dismisses his claim. If the player then travels to Ten Carat Hill, they will encounter the mysterious Necrozma, a Pokémon that is said to be highly reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts.
