        <h1>Black and White</h1>
        <p>
          The game starts in Nuvema Town in the player's room with Cheren, a childhood friend. Professor Juniper has left a gift box for the two and Bianca, another one of the player's friends, who arrives a little later. The box contains three Pokémon that the player can choose from. After the selection, Bianca will request a battle. When the battle is over, the room becomes cluttered due to the battle. Cheren heals both the player's and Bianca's Pokémon, and begins a battle with the player as well. If the player loses to Cheren, he will gloat about his victory. The three then go downstairs, and Cheren and Bianca will leave the house while the player's Mom will heal the Pokémon.
          <br>
          <br>
          The player visits Bianca's house, where she and her father are having an argument about her going on a Pokémon journey. Bianca storms out of the house, and the player follows her to Professor Juniper's lab, where Cheren has been waiting. In the lab, Professor Juniper will give the player a chance to nickname the selected starter Pokémon, and give each of the three a Pokédex. Upon leaving the lab, they will be greeted by the player's mother, who will hand everyone a Town Map.
          <br>
          <br>
          From then on, the player will set off on adventures through the Unova region. Along the way, the player, Cheren, and Bianca will battle eight Gym Leaders, while trying to complete the Pokédex. After managing to obtain all eight Badges, the player will head to the Pokémon League to battle the Elite Four and the Champion. Cheren decides to pursue strength and Bianca realizes that she cannot match the skills of the player or Cheren.
          <br>
          <br>
          However, the adventure does not go as smoothly as expected, as the evil Team Plasma will be encountered along the way to the Pokémon League. Team Plasma's goal is to separate Pokémon from people; claiming that humans are only hindrances to the lives and interests of Pokémon. The player will occasionally encounter N, the mysterious leader of the organization. Ghetsis, a co-founding member of the Seven Sages, has a secret, different goal from N's. The player must learn of and thwart their plans in order to save the relationship between Pokémon and their Trainers.
          <br>
          <br>
          Once the player enters the Champion's room, N is shown to have defeated Alder, and proceeds to summon his castle to ambush and attach to the Pokémon League. The player traverses through the castle to find N and his legendary dragon, who claims to be the hero. However, the Light StoneB/Dark StoneW in the player's Bag is released and summons the second dragon hero, Reshiram/Zekrom, which the player captures and uses to battle and defeat N.
          <br>
          <br>
          Once defeated, Ghetsis angrily intervenes, revealing his intentions of creating Team Plasma for his own interests of power, and how N and the idea of Pokémon liberation were merely his tools. In a rage, he battles the player in an attempt to eliminate any witnesses of the truth. His actions are futile, however, and N reconsiders his actions and ideas.

        <h1>Black 2 and White 2</h1>
        <p>
          The games take place two years after the events of Pokémon Black and White. Many changes have taken place in Unova over this period: new locations are accessible in the southwest and northeast of the region, and some previously existing locations cannot be visited or are restricted until later in the game. Three new Gym Leaders and a new Champion are introduced, while the Unova Pokédex is expanded to include Pokémon foreign to the region, much like in Pokémon Platinum.
          <br>
          <br>
          The player—named, by default, Nate if male or Rosa if female—begins in the southwestern city Aspertia City. After receiving their first Pokémon from Professor Juniper's assistant Bianca, they are encouraged to battle in Pokémon Gyms and aim for the Pokémon League. A boy from the player's hometown, Hugh, will travel with the player at certain times. Though filling the traditional rival role, Hugh is not pursuing the Pokémon League challenge: it is revealed that he is trying to recover a stolen Pokémon from Team Plasma, who were not disbanded two years prior as expected.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the course of their journey, the player and Hugh will have numerous encounters with both current and former members of Team Plasma, as well as the mysterious scientist Colress. One of the Seven Sages, Zinzolin, appears in an antagonistic role, yet former sage Rood will help the player. The plot comes to a head when Zinzolin freezes Opelucid City in ice with a combination of technology and the legendary dragon Kyurem, which Team Plasma has captured. The player must defeat Team Plasma including its new leader Ghetsis to free Kyurem. Ghetsis will combine the power of Kyurem with the power of the legendary dragon befriended by his son two years earlier and force Kyurem to fuse with ZekromB2 or ReshiramW2. Only once Kyurem is safe and Team Plasma has been disbanded can the player continue his or her journey to the Pokémon League.
          <br>
          <br>
          After the main plot of the game has been completed, many inaccessible parts of Unova, including the Skyarrow Bridge, will be unlocked. Further Pokémon not native to Unova will be available, and the legendary Pokémon ZekromB2/ReshiramW2 and Kyurem will reveal themselves to the player. When they are caught, the player will be able to fuse the Pokémon and change Kyurem's form at will.
